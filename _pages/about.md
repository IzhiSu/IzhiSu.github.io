<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

In pursuit of excellence in Artificial Intelligence, I am driven by a passion for innovation and a relentless curiosity to explore the frontiers of technology. With a solid foundation in computer science and a track record of research projects in machine learning and data analysis, I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research in AI. I am committed to pushing boundaries, solving complex problems, and shaping the future of AI through rigorous academic inquiry and collaborative exploration.

I am now an undergraduate majoring in software engineering at Guangzhou University. My research interest includes computer vision and meta-learning. I am now working on 3D reconstruction, continous learning, and few-shot learning research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at <a href='yuanzhisu@e.gzhu.edu.cn'>yuanzhisu@e.gzhu.edu.cn</a>.
